This is my dotfiles repo. It contains my dotfiles, configured to my liking.
It has been rewritten for plain ZSH with a custom color scheme and no configuration framework dependencies.


## ZSH
### Features

- Colored prompt with Git branch along with dirty/clean indicators
- Tab completion with colors and menu selection
- LS colors
- ZSH syntax highlighting
- Not framework-dependent.

### Installation

Just copy the `.zshrc` to your home directory:
`cp .zshrc ~/.zshrc`
